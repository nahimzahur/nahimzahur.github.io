### [Long-term Contracts and Efficiency in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvfh0of1r5vg8ff/NahimZahur_LNG_Contracts_Draft_2019.pdf?dl=0 "Long-term Contracts and Efficiency in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry")

In many capital-intensive markets, sellers sign long-term contracts with buyers before committing to sunk cost investments. The use of ex-ante contracting facilitates efficient levels of investment by reducing distortions arising from ex-post bargaining. However, contractual rigidities reduce the ability of firms to respond flexibly to demand shocks. This paper provides an empirical analysis of this trade-off, focusing on the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry, where long-term contracts account for over 70% of trade. I develop a model of contracting, investment and spot trade that incorporates bargaining frictions and contractual rigidities. I then structurally estimate this model using a rich dataset of LNG contracts, investment, and trade flows, employing a novel estimation strategy that utilizes the timing of contracting and investment decisions to infer bargaining power. I find that LNG buyers have substantial bargaining power, which distorts the investment decisions made by sellers. In the short-run, allocative efficiency would improve through reduced use of long-term contracts. However, investment would decrease by 35% in the absence of long-run contracting.

### [Industrial Policy Implementation: Empirical Evidence from China's Shipbuilding Industry](https://www.dropbox.com/s/553xi6okmeimqrn/Yr21_ChinaShipyard_Sep27.pdf?dl=0 "Industrial Policy Implementation: Empirical Evidence from China's Shipbuilding Industry") 
with Panle Jia Barwick and Myrto Kalouptsidi, 2021. NBER Working Paper No. 26075.



Industrial policies are widely used across the world. In practice, designing and implementing these policies is a complicated task. In this paper, we assess the long-term performance of different industrial policy instruments, which include production subsidies, investment subsidies, entry subsidies, and consolidation policies. To do so, we examine a recent industrial policy in China aiming to propel the country’s shipbuilding industry to the largest globally. Using firm-level data and a dynamic model of firm entry, exit, investment, and production, we find that (i) the policy boosted China’s domestic investment, entry, and international market share dramatically, but delivered low returns and led to fragmentation, idle capacity, as well as depressed world ship prices; (ii) the effectiveness of different policy instruments is mixed: production and investment subsidies can be justified by market share considerations, while entry subsidies are wasteful; (iii) counter-cyclical policies and firm-targeting can substantially
reduce distortions. Our results highlight the critical role of firm heterogeneity, business cycles and firms’ cost structure in policy design.


### [The Healthcare Cost of Air Pollution: Evidence from the World's Largest Payment Network](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fnf9xum7ufayxfy/Yr21_May21_PollutionHealth.pdf?dl=0 "The Healthcare Cost of Air Pollution: Evidence from the World's Largest Payment Network")
with Panle Jia Barwick, Shanjun Li and Deyu Rao, 2021. NBER Working Paper No. 24688. Revise and resubmit at *Review of Economics and Statistics*. 

Using the universe of credit- and debit-card transactions in China during 2013-2015, this paper provides the first nationwide analysis of the healthcare cost of PM2.5. We leverage spatial spillovers of PM2.5 from long-range transport for exogenous variation in local pollution and employ a flexible distributed lag model to capture semiparametrically the dynamic response of pollution exposure. Our analysis shows significant impacts of PM2.5 on healthcare spending in both the short and medium terms. A 10 mg/m3 decrease in PM2.5 would reduce annual healthcare spending by more than $9.2 billion, about 1.5% of China’s annual healthcare expenditure.

### [Procurement Institutions and Essential Drug Supply in Low and Middle-Income Countries](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3926761 "Procurement Institutions and Essential Drug Supply in Low and Middle-Income Countries")
with Lucy Xiaolu Wang, 2021

International procurement institutions have played an important role in drug supply. This paper studies price, delivery, and shipment time of essential drugs supplied in 106 developing countries from 2007-2017 across four procurement institution types. We find that pooled procurement institutions lower prices: pooling internationally is most effective for small buyers and more concentrated markets, and pooling within-country is most effective for large buyers and less concentrated markets. Pooling can reduce delays, but at the cost of longer anticipated shipment times. Finally, pooled procurement is more effective for older generation drugs, compared to IP licensing institutions that focus on newer, patented drugs. We corroborate the findings using multiple identification strategies, including an instrumental variable strategy as well as the Altonji-Elder-Taber-Oster method for selection on unobservables. Our results suggest that the optimal mixture of procurement institutions depends on the trade-off between costs and urgency of need, with pooled international procurement institutions particularly valuable when countries can plan well ahead of time.


### [Market Power and Spatial Price Discrimination in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u181kafor0v1ywl/NahimZahur_LNG_MarketPower_Draft_NOV2019.pdf?dl=0 "Market Power and Spatial Price Discrimination in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry")

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry is characterized by systematic inter-regional price differentials, raising the question of whether sellers price discriminate. This paper measures market power in the LNG spot market and studies how market power influences pricing, trade and welfare. I develop a method for inferring market conduct that utilizes information on sellers’ pricing and quantity decisions across multiple geographically segmented markets. My test for market conduct is based on the observation that sellers exercising market power engage in third-degree price discrimination, whereas sellers behaving competitively do not. Using data
from 2006 to 2017 on spot market trade flows, spot prices, shipping costs and seller capacities, I estimate a structural model of LNG trade and pricing that incorporates spatial differentiation, capacity constraints and trade frictions and flexibly nests different models of seller market power. I find that seller decisions are consistent with a Cournot model and unlikely to be generated by a competitive model. The total deadweight loss from market power is estimated to be USD 12 billion, or about 4.5% of total revenue. I find that market power plays a key role in exacerbating inter-regional price differentials.


## Works in Progress

### Traffic Congestion and Consumer Spending
with Deyu Rao

The cost of congestion is a key input in the design of transportation policy. Existing estimates of the social cost of traffic congestion account for the value of travel time, increased air pollution and accidents, and the impact on subjective well-being. We highlight an important additional cost: congestion disrupts economic activities. Consumers who cancel or postpone their spending plans on congested days incur a cost from not being able to engage in consumption at their preferred time. This paper investigates how traffic congestion affects consumption, focusing on Beijing in 2014. Using high-frequency credit and debit card consumption and traffic congestion data, we show that a 10% increase in travel time leads to a 2.4% decrease in consumption on the same day. We find little evidence to suggest that consumers substitute consumption over time.
